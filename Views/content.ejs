                The University of Southampton (abbreviated as Soton in post-nominal letters[4]) is a research university
                in Southampton, England. The university's origins date back to the founding of the Hartley Institution
                in 1862. In 1902, the Institution developed into the Hartley University College, awarding degrees from
                the University of London. On 29 April 1952, the institution was granted full university status, allowing
                it to award its own degrees.

                The university has seven teaching campuses. The main campus is located in the Highfield area of
                Southampton and is supplemented by four other campuses within the city: Avenue Campus housing the School
                of Humanities, the National Oceanography Centre housing courses in Ocean and Earth Sciences, Southampton
                General Hospital offering courses in Medicine and Health Sciences, and Boldrewood Campus housing an
                engineering and maritime technology campus and Lloyd's Register. In addition, the university operates a
                School of Art based in nearby Winchester and an international branch in Malaysia offering courses in
                Engineering. Each campus is equipped with its own library facilities. Southampton is a founding member
                of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities in Britain, it is also affiliated to the
                Port-City University League of universities in major port cities and the Worldwide Universities Network.

                The University of Southampton currently has 15,790 undergraduate and 6,925 postgraduate students, making
                it the largest university by higher education students in the South East region. The University of
                Southampton Students' Union, provides support, representation and social activities for the students
                ranging from involvement in the Union's four media outlets, to any of the 200 affiliated societies and
                80 sports.[5] The university owns and operates a sports ground for use by students and also operates a
                sports centre on the main campus.[6]
